Problems to find:
 * Unnecessary header files included
   - Totally unused
   - Used by could forward declare classes instead
 * Unnecessary forward class declarations
 * Sources that reference headers not included (relies on transitive include)
 * Unused members (private, protected, and public) both methods and data

Non-goals:
 * Parsing all valid C++ source
 * Parsing invalid C++ source
 * Compiling to machine code (or anything beyond an AST)
